# Binding Controller and View with Hardcoded Data

## Introduction

Since we just learned how to set up an Angular app, and how controllers and views work, today, we'll be practicing exactly that.

Your mission is to build a new Angular app from scratch, set up multiple controllers, and render them all in a single view. This will be a quick little site for a museum with information about an future exhibit, general museum information and hours, and donor information.

## Exercise

- Set up an Angular app and test that it works
- Build 3 basic controllers with fake data:
  + A controller with information about an example exhibit that's coming up
  + A controller with general operation information, like hours, address, phone number, etc.
  + A controller with information for donors, like contact information for the head of the museum, what sort of donations are accepted, etc.
- Render basic controller data in the view, with a section for each controller


#### Deliverable

A simple hardcoded Angular app with 3 controller files, an app file, and an `index.html`
